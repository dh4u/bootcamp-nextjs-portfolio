# Online Store with Shopping Cart

![](Images/guitarist.center.screenshot.png)

This was the second capstone project for the Web Development Essentials track of the Full Stack Developer bootcamp I did.

## The Assignment
> Your online store is required to implement the following JavaScript functionality:
> * Create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
> * Allow a “quick add to cart” from the catalogue page.
> * Each product’s page must also have the option to “add to cart”.
> * When an item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
> * Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in their cart, each item’s price, and the total cost (remember to add VAT!)
> * Create a form which allows for “discount coupons”.
> * Create forms to allow a user to select “collection” or “delivery”.
> * Create forms for different delivery options.
> * Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and if a certain coupon is applied.
> * Create a “confirm order” button which alerts the user that their order was successful and generates them a reference number (keyword: generate)
>
> * Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
> > * A function which contains hiding/showing.
> > * A drop-down menu.
> > * Animation effects.
> > * A function with chained effects.

## The Solution
This second iteration of the store has a functional shopping cart page designed with a [Bootstrap Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example) and places the catalog items in an array that is stored in sessionStorage.
